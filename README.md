# LED-Snowflake
This Christmas decoration was made with the intent of mass producing these for friends/family.  Didn't necessarily turn out that way...but I ended up building around 15 or so for friends/family during Christmas 2018 :christmas_tree:

## Getting Started

Due to the nature of this project, the code isn't necessarily transferrable to other domains unless you built an LED Snowflake as well (and if you've built a similar project I would love to see what you created! :smile: )

## Built With

* [Arduino Nano] - The microcontroller used
* [WS2812B RGB 5050 LED Strip] â€“ LEDs inside the snowflake

## CAD Files

The necessary STL files are provided in the docs so you can print your own snowflake!  Feel free to modify it how you see fit :smile:

## Directions

Currently, the directions are laid out in a PDF so you can download them at your lesiure and take them with you wherever you build it.  Everything should be explained thoroughly, but if you have some questions or whatnot, feel free to drop a comment and let me know!
